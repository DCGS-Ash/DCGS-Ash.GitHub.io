 We started the lesson by learning how to make a Caesar Cypher, Mr.Keen made us work out how to do it at the front of the class so all of us knew how to do it, and not just him explaining it and his explanation hitting our ears and bouncing off and us putting our hands up and going 'Sir'. But, I digress. We then went back to our desks and started doing it ourselves. I managed to do most of it didn’t get onto putting in the code where by which Shift was typed in you could change the outcome. Then  the bell wnet and the lesson ended.

This lesson taught me how to do the Shift cyphers on Slides, this will help me greatly in the future for any workplace I am in as it means I can keep track of things easily and efficiently.</td>

I can maybe listen a bit more so I don’t have to look at the board as much as I did, which isn’t a good thing and means  probably won’t remember it for long as I would if I had listened properly.
