 This was a great start to a new year in I.T. We were first tasked with trying to work out what 'Gdmmp' meant (it was hello). This as it would later turn out was encryption, Caesar Encryption. We then proceeded on to talk about different types of encryption, such as the type they use for airports, LAX = Los Angeles Airport, HRH = Heathrow. After this we started talking about good passwords, what makes a good password and how to make a good strong password. Mr.Keen showed us a few sites that tested our passwords strength and told you how long it would take to crack them. Then unfortunately the bell went and the lesson ended.

    <td>
This lesson taught me a bit about encrypting and encoding, it also taught me that if Mr.Keen wanted to get information to peopleâ€™s computers such as passwords he would be able to do it very easily.

I can listen a bit more clearly and take all the information in not just some of it.
